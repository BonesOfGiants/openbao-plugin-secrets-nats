# openbao-plugin-secrets-nats

OpenBao secrets plugin with dynamic JWT generation and templating for NATS secrets.

## About This Project

This is a fork of the archived [edgefarm/vault-plugin-secrets-nats](https://github.com/edgefarm/vault-plugin-secrets-nats) project and the subsequent 'enhanced' fork by [nunu-ai](https://github.com/nunu-ai/vault-plugin-secrets-nats). 
Originally developed for HashiCorp Vault, it has been adapted for use with OpenBao.
